# Landing-Page
CSS Flexbox exercise

This is a project from the Odin Project to create a Landing Page using Flexbox. There is a template given that I have to emulate, the topic of the landing page to my discretion. I will make a landing page for Alpaca Wool products (i.e. ponchos, beanies, rugs, etc.) Images are credited below.
